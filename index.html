    <h1>Softcore  By the Neighbourhood</h1>
    <p> And all I am is a man
        I want the world in my hands
        I hate the beach
        But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
        Use the sleeves of my sweater
        Let's have an adventure
        Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
        Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
        You in those little high waisted shorts, oh</p>

        <p> Oh, she knows what I think about
            And what I think about
            One love, two mouths
            One love, one house
            No shirt, no blouse
            Just us, you find out
            Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
            'Cause it's too cold
            For you here
            And now, so let me hold
            Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>
 
            <p>And if I may just take your breath away
                I don't mind if there's not much to say
                Sometimes the silence guides a mind
                To move to a place so far away
                The goosebumps start to raise
                The minute that my left hand meets your waist
                And then I watch your face
                Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
                These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
                Inside this place is warm
                Outside it starts to pour
                </p>

                <p> Coming down
                    One love, two mouths
                    One love, one house
                    No shirt, no blouse
                    Just us, you find out
                    Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
                    'Cause it's too cold
                    For you here
                    And now, so let me hold
                    Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                    Coming down</p>

                    <p> 'Cause it's too cold
                        For you here
                        And now, so let me hold
                        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                        </p>
                        <p> Whoa, whoa, whoa
                            Whoa, whoa, whoa
                            Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
                            Whoa, whoa
                            Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
                            Whoa, whoa
                            </p>

                            <p> Cause it's too cold
                                For you here
                                And now, so let me hold
                                Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>

                                <p>It's too cold
                                    For you here
                                    And now, let me hold
                                    Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                                    And it's too cold, it's too cold
                                    The holes of my sweater </p>
